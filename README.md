bin_catalog

Routines to read Aki, Engdahl, and Havard/Global CMT earthquake
catalogs and perform some basic computations, including computing
Gutenberg-Richter fits, binning and merging catalogs.

Code can also compute Michael (1984) type best-fit stress tensors as
and Kostrov summations, as well as Vavryčuk (2014) iterative
inversions.

Contains some versions of Andy Michael's code, as well as GMT4.5.18
code - see their copyright.

Also contains some of Vavryčuk's stress inversion code, in modified
ways.
